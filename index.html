                    <p>Overwatch is an upcoming multiplayer first-person shooter in development by Blizzard 
                    Entertainment. Unveiled at BlizzCon 2014, the game emphasizes cooperative gameplay using 
                    a cast of various "heroes", each with their own abilities and roles within a team. The game 
                    entered closed beta in North America and Europe on October 27, 2015, with plans to bring the 
                    beta to Asia at a later date. The final closed beta weekend began on April 15, 2016 and primarily 
                    served as a stress test for Overwatch's servers, lasting 36 hours.[2] The game is scheduled to be 
                    released on May 24, 2016, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
